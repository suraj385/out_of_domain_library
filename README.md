# Out of Domain LibraryThis library provides tools for feature extraction and similarity checking using a ResNet-50 model. It can be used to determine whether an image is in-domain or out-of-domain based on cosine similarity with a set of gallery features.## InstallationTo use this library, simply clone the repository and install the required packages. in bashgit clone https://github.com/suraj385/out_of_domain_library.gitcd out_of_domain_librarypip install -r requirements.txtNoteYou can change the threshold value for determining in-domain status in line 38 of similarity_check.py. , it generated 99.77% accuracy with 0.85UsageExtract and Save Gallery FeaturespythonCopy codefrom out_of_domain.feature_extraction import save_gallery_features# Path to the folder containing imagesimage_folder = "/path/to/image/folder"# Extract features and save to a filesave_gallery_features(image_folder, "gallery_features.npy")Check if an Image is In-DomainpythonCopy codefrom out_of_domain.similarity_check import is_in_domainimport numpy as np# Load gallery featuresgallery_features = np.load("gallery_features.npy")# Path to the test imagetest_image_path = "/path/to/test/image.jpg"# Check if the test image is in-domainresult = is_in_domain(test_image_path, gallery_features)print("In-Domain" if result else "Out-of-Domain")Evaluate the ModelpythonCopy codefrom out_of_domain.similarity_check import evaluate_modelimport numpy as np# Load gallery featuresgallery_features = np.load("gallery_features.npy")# Path to the folder containing test imagestest_folder = "/path/to/test/folder"# Evaluate the modelcorrect, total, accuracy = evaluate_model(gallery_features, test_folder, True)print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
